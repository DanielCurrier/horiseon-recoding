# Horiseon Recoding Project

## Description
This project has been made as a means of making the Horiseon website more accessible by refactoring both the HTML and CSS files that make up its contents. After learning more about web accessibility and its importance,I decided that it was essential to refactor this page by adding semantic elements to its HTML file  and truncate its CSS elements down significantly. At the project's conclusion, I can safely say that this criteria has been met!
